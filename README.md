# NYPD call assistant

---

This project of the part of requirement task at Data Science club at PJATK. 

We were provided with NYPD dataset, with ~9 millions rows, model that we needed to train was up to our decision, so we decided to make Call assistant for 911 call center. 

## Steps to run this project
Do step by step 

1. run command `python main.py download_data` 
2. run command `python main.py preprocess_data`
3. run command `python train_model`
4. run command `streamlit run app.py`

## Problems

Because of luck of time, we created the POS, rather than well-structured project, we had to sacrifice model accuracy, quality of GUI and data cleaning steps were not as thorough as we would like(probably every aspect of the project has space to improve)
